# IndoorPaths

IndoorPaths was created to facilitate NTU students' navigation on campus. It accurately pinpoints a location inside a building (ex. The Arc).

This app was developed with AndroidStudio and the [IndoorAtlas MapCreator tool](http://docs.indooratlas.com/android/).

### Inspo ###
This idea came into our mind when we signed up for a digital campus transformation competition organized by Rakuten RapidAPI in Singapore. We were supposed to make the life in the school campus better. We were curious what where people struggling with here, on the university campus. We asked more than 50 students and 23 Students told me - without hesitation - that it is hard to find the right way to the classrooms. In the beginning, that was our personal struggle as well. The campus is huge and there is no digitalized map. We were curious how other companies or institutions were solving this issue. We got feedback from a couple of companies that were actually looking for solutions, but it was not easy to find one. Especially companies who have big production halls or big storage rooms like IKEA, school campuses like Nanyang Technology University or National University of Singapore were interested in digitalized maps.

Let us introduce you our indoor digitalized map, which we made with the help of the platform IndoorAtlas.
